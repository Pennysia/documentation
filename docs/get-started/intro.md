# Overview
Pennysia is an AMM protocol engineered to be its most optimized for liquidity providers' profitability.

- **Liquidity Models**: Its modular design is capable of supporting multiple AMM models. 
- **Liquidty Prediction Market (LPM)**: LPs can choose a directional bias (long or short on either asset) to maximize revenue and combat impermanent loss.
- **Precision-Oriented Oracle (cbrtTWAP)**: Our cube-root time-weighted average price blends the precision of arithmetic mean with the stability of geometric mean, resisting manipulation while staying responsive.
- **Singleton Architecture**: All earned fees are automatically reinvested into your liquidity position, growing your share without extra transactions or gas costs.
- **Fungible Liquidity Token**: LP tokens are fungible and can be integrated with other DeFi protocols.
- **Auto-Compounded Rewards**: All pools live inside a single smart contract instance, minimizing gas usage and enabling more advanced routing and analytics.

We launch with the proven $x*y=k$ model as our foundation to help users get familiar with the LPM concept, with additional AMM models planned for future releases.

# Unveiling Pennysia's Edge
Pennysia' [backtest](../resources/backtest) using 4 years of historical data (2021-2024), demonstrates Pennysia's clear financial edge over Uniswap V2 and traditional XYK models Pennysia, with its innovative Liquidity Prediction Market (LPM), allows Liquidity Providers (LPs) to take directional positions. Correct predictions earn double trading fees, specifically designed to offset impermanent loss (IL). This led to substantially higher returns, especially in trending and volatile markets. Our analysis shows Pennysia can offer APRs over 100% when predictions are correct, significantly **outperforming Uniswap V2's typical 71%**, validating its potential for superior liquidity provision.
