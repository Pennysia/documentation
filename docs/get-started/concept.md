# Concept
Learn about our innovative concepts.

## Background
Pennysia began at the **Sonic S-Tier Hackathon in August 2025**, where we first introduced the groundbreaking concept of the **Liquidity Prediction Market** — a fusion of AMM mechanics and prediction-based yield enhancement.

> The project went on to **win 1st place**, officially recognized and published on [**October 2, 2025**](https://x.com/PennysiaLabs/status/1973696631813136445).

The version you are reading now represents the **refined evolution beyond our initial MVP**, integrating multiple new innovations while staying true to our core mission: to build a **low-risk, high-reward DeFi protocol** that empowers everyone to become a market maker and earn passive income effortlessly and sustainably.


## Vision

Pennysia reimagines decentralized market making as a sustainable, user-driven ecosystem. In traditional finance, only large institutions could act as market makers. In DeFi, while AMMs opened access to everyone, most users still face high volatility, limited yield, and complex risks. Pennysia bridges this gap — empowering anyone to become a low-risk, high-efficiency market maker, while giving new Web3 projects a reliable liquidity foundation to grow.


## Problems We Tackle
We addresses challenges faced by two key user groups:
### 1. General DeFi Users (B2C)

Most users seek low-risk and consistent returns, but current DeFi yield opportunities are either volatile, short-lived, or depend on unsustainable token incentives. There is a need for a reliable and perpetual source of passive income that compounds automatically and does not expose users to excessive market risk.

### 2. Web3 Projects and Protocols (B2B)

New projects often struggle with illiquidity and price discovery. Launching tokens requires continuous liquidity and integration support, which are costly and complex to maintain. Projects need plug-and-play liquidity markets that are robust, compatible with existing industry standards, and come with shared revenue incentives.

## Solution For Users

Enhancing yield while keeping risk constant:

### 1.AMM + Prediction Market Fusion
    
By integrating prediction-market mechanics into the Uniswap V2 AMM model, users can express directional market views to boost yield. Even if their prediction is incorrect, their **principal liquidity remains intact** — no liquidation, no loss of ownership. We called this feature ‘LPM’.
    
### 2.Integrated Passive Yield through Aave
    
Liquidity within the AMM is automatically delegated to Aave(if supported), allowing users to **earn dual yields** — one from trading fees and another from lending interest — without any active management or additional risk.

## **Solution For Projects**

Empowering builders with sustainable liquidity tools:

### 1.Battle-Tested AMM Foundation
    
Built on the Uniswap V2 model, Pennysia ensures **infinite price range coverage** and **predictable behavior**, eliminating liquidity depletion risks for new or volatile tokens.
    
### 2.Revenue Sharing Program
    
Projects receive **up to 50% of protocol-generated revenue** from their deployed markets — distributed automatically and permissionlessly to encourage ecosystem growth.
    
### 3.Fungible LP Tokens for Composability
    
All LP positions are represented by fungible tokens, enabling seamless integration into DeFi ecosystems such as staking, liquidity mining, lending, or bonding platforms.
