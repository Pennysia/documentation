## Steps
1. Select Token Pair: Choose the first token and second token you want to provide liquidity for.

    - For new pools: You'll be creating a brand new liquidity pool
2. Enter Amounts: Specify the amount for each token you want to add as liquidity.
    - The interface automatically calculates the corresponding amounts based on current pool ratios
    - For new pools, you set the initial price ratio
3. Set Position Type: Choose your liquidity position strategy:
    - Long Position: Bullish on the token pair
    - Short Position: Bearish on the token pair
4. Review Details: Check the estimated LP tokens you'll receive and pool share percentage.
5. Click the 'Add Liquidity' button to execute the transaction.
6. Approve Tokens (if needed): Your wallet will prompt you to approve token spending (one-time setup per token).
7. Your wallet pops up to sign/confirm the transaction, click confirm.
8. Done. You'll receive LP tokens representing your liquidity position.
