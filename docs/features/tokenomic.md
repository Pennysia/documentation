## SIA - The Protocol Token
Pennysia (SIA) is the native token of the Pennysia protocol. It is designed as a decentralized instrument to distribute value, governance power, and other benefits to those who support the protocol. The core idea is simple: **SIA reflects the growth and success of the protocol**.

## Use Cases
### 1. Decentralized Reserve
Each SIA represents a share of all the accrued protocol fees in both tokens and LP positions. SIA holder can withdraw these shares by selecting tokens and LP positions of choice and deposit SIA proportionally. 

::: info :information_source:  INFO
All deposited SIA tokens will be permanently burned, and re-minting is not possible.

### 2. Protocol Scaling
SIA tokens will be used to scale the development and production of Pennysia protocol and other related products and services. The relevance may include:
1. Product/service incentives
2. Third-party integrations
3. Fundraise
4. Team & hiring
5. Grants

### 3. Governance
The Pennysia protocol's governance is driven by the SIA token holder community, who contribute to shape the future of the protocol by deciding on important events and upgrades. The processes include submitting proposals, open discussion, voting, and execution.
