# Deployer Incentive Program

The Deployer Incentive Program is designed to empower builders and project teams to launch new markets on Pennysia with built-in revenue sharing and long-term sustainability.

## How It Works

- Every market deployed on Pennysia automatically participates in the revenue-sharing model.
- Up to **50% of the protocol fee** collected from that market is **distributed directly to the market deployer**.
- Distribution is executed **automatically and permissionlessly**, ensuring full transparency and trustless operation.

## Purpose

This incentive aligns Pennysia’s growth with the success of its ecosystem partners. It encourages:

- Developers to create and maintain active markets.
- Projects to bootstrap liquidity without external funding.
- Communities to launch their own DeFi ecosystems sustainably.


## Fee Switch

The Fee Switch is a built-in mechanism for long-term sustainability.

When activated, it temporarily pauses the Deployer Incentive Program, redirecting the deployer’s revenue share of fees back to the protocol treasury.

By default, the Fee Switch is turned off, ensuring deployers receive their full incentive. It may be activated in the future only if additional funding is needed to support Pennysia’s development, operations, or security.
