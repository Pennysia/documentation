# Flashloan
Pennysia introduces a next-generation **multi-token flashloan system**, built directly into its **singleton architecture**.

Unlike traditional flashloans that operate on isolated liquidity pools, Pennysia’s unified contract architecture allows **all tokens within the protocol** to be accessed from a **shared global balance sheet**.

This enables developers and traders to execute **complex multi-asset operations** within a single transaction — efficiently, securely, and gas-optimized.


## Key Features

1. **Multi-Token Flashloans**
    
    Borrow multiple tokens simultaneously within one atomic transaction. This enables advanced on-chain strategies such as **multi-pair arbitrage**, **portfolio rebalancing**, **collateral refinancing**, or **batch liquidations** — all executed seamlessly in one call.
    
2. **Universal Liquidity Access**
    
    Because all markets reside inside a **single smart contract**, Pennysia treats every token reserve as part of a unified liquidity system. This design removes the need for per-pair pool isolation, maximizing capital utilization and reducing redundant operations.
    
3. **Gas Efficiency**
    
    The singleton model eliminates repetitive state changes across multiple pools, resulting in **significantly lower gas costs** compared to legacy AMM-based flashloan designs.
    
4. **Security and Atomicity**
    
    All flashloan operations are **fully atomic** — borrowed assets must be returned within the same transaction. If repayment fails, the entire operation reverts automatically, ensuring zero risk to the protocol and its liquidity providers.

## Use Cases

- Cross-asset arbitrage across multiple Pennysia markets
- On-chain liquidations and debt refinancing
- Multi-token swaps or portfolio hedging
- Capital-efficient composable DeFi strategies


## Fee Structure

A **flat 0.1% fee** is applied to all flashloan transactions, collected as a protocol fee and contributes directly to Pennysia’s sustainability and ecosystem development.

## Access and Developer Support

Flashloan is a developer-focused feature, accessible through a smart contract.
