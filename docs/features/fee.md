## Overview
There are 3 sources of revenue stream that powers the ecosystem of the protocol.

### 1.Swap Fee
A 0.3% fee is applied to each token swap, charged in the form of the output token.
- 95% of the collected fees are distributed among liquidity providers, proportional to their share of the liquidity reserves. These fees are automatically compounded to increase the value of their liquidity tokens.
- 5% of the collected fees are retained as a protocol fee.

### 2.Liquidity Fee
A 0.3% fee is charged upon liquidity withdrawal and liquidity swap, deducted from the liquidity position output.
- 95% of the collected fees are distributed among liquidity providers in the corresponding direction, and are automatically compounded to increase the value of their liquidity tokens.
For example, if a user withdraws from a short-TokenA position in the TokenA/TokenB pool, the 0.3% fee is charged in short-TokenA and distributed proportionally to all existing short-TokenA liquidity positions.
- 5% of the collected fees are retained as a protocol fee.

### 3.Flashloan Fee
A 0.3% fee is applied to each flashloan call.
- 100% of the collected fees are retained as a protocol fee.
